# Agent Design Notes — SVG Infographic Creation

## Overview
This project creates SVG infographics and graphics for Elastic dev-advocacy content, rendered to PNG via `@resvg/resvg-js`. Graphics range from cheat-sheet cards to pipeline diagrams to standalone presentation visuals.

## ⚡ Prime Directive — Style From References, Content From Task

**Before writing any SVG, study the reference examples in `references/`.** Your job is to:
1. **Follow the content and layout** specified in the task brief — what to show and how it's arranged
2. **Match the visual style** (colors, card patterns, typography, tone) of the existing references

The task defines **what** to show and **where** (content and layout). The references define **how** it looks (colors, styling, typography treatment). Do not invent a new visual style — adapt from what already exists in this repo.

- **Content** = text, data, labels, descriptions — comes from the task
- **Layout** = spatial arrangement, grid, grouping, flow direction — comes from the task (layout is part of the content)
- **Styling** = colors, fonts, card borders, shadows, backgrounds, accent treatments — comes from the references

**Workflow:**
1. Read the task brief to understand the content, layout, and format requirements
2. Study `references/*.svg` and their rendered `*.png` files — look at colors, cards, font treatments, and overall feel
3. Pick the closest reference as your styling starting point and apply its visual language to the task's content and layout
4. Use this AGENTS.md for specific measurements, resvg quirks, and edge cases

**If the task specifies style constraints** (e.g. transparent background, dark-bg compatible), respect those — but still derive your visual language from the references. A transparent-bg overlay should use the same card style, fonts, and colors as the references, just without the background fill.

---

## ⛔ Non-Negotiable Rules (Read These First)

These are the most commonly violated rules. Check every one before writing SVG.

1. **Use the font size table.** On a 2400px canvas: title = 72px, body/labels = 24–27px, monospace = 25.5–27px, footer = 17px. On an 860px canvas: title = 48px, body = 15.5px. See the full Font Size Scaling table below. Do NOT guess — look up the sizes.

2. **Card fill is ALWAYS `#ffffff` (white).** Never use colored or tinted fills for card backgrounds, row backgrounds, or section backgrounds. No pastel tints (`#f0fff4`, `#f0f6ff`, `#fff8f0`). The card interior is white — always.

3. **Accent color = stroke/border only, never fill.** A card's accent color goes on its `stroke` attribute, not its `fill`. The only place accent colors appear as fills are in small label pills/badges (e.g. a 100×30px rounded-rect pill with white text inside) — never on the card itself or on full-width header bars.

4. **No invented visual patterns.** Every visual element in your output should have a clear precedent in the reference PNGs. If you can't point to a reference for a design choice (e.g. "full-width colored header banner", "tinted row backgrounds", "spreadsheet grid lines"), don't make that choice. Decompose your layout into the existing card building block instead.

5. **Render and compare.** After your first draft, run `node render.js` and visually compare to the closest reference PNG at the same zoom level. If your text looks noticeably smaller than the reference, it IS smaller — increase font sizes.

6. **When the task assigns semantic meaning to colors** (e.g. quality=green, speed=blue, cost=orange), use those colors as the card **border stroke** color and in small label pills — not as background fills or header bar fills.

The rest of this file provides detailed specifications and hard-won lessons. It is organized in three layers:
1. **Universal fundamentals** — brand, fonts, rendering pipeline, resvg quirks. Applies to ALL graphics.
2. **Design system templates** — specific patterns for known graphic types (cheat-sheets, pipelines). Use when the task matches.
3. **Common pitfalls** — hard-won lessons that apply broadly.

---

# UNIVERSAL FUNDAMENTALS

Everything in this section applies to every graphic, regardless of type.

## Rendering Pipeline

### Setup
- **resvg-js** is installed globally at `/Users/jphwang/.local/share/mise/installs/node/22.22.0/lib/node_modules/@resvg/resvg-js`
- Use `render.js` to convert SVG → PNG: `node render.js <input.svg> <output.png>`
- resvg loads system fonts, so `font-family` values should include fallbacks (e.g. `Inter, system-ui, -apple-system, sans-serif`)

### Output Resolution & Aspect Ratio
- `render.js` scales all SVGs to **1600px wide**, preserving the SVG's aspect ratio. This is for preview/QA purposes only — final assets can be up/downscaled in an editor.
- **Do not modify `render.js`** to hit a specific pixel target. If the task requires e.g. 1920×1080, set the SVG `viewBox` to a **16:9 ratio** (e.g. `4800 2700`, `1920 1080`, `3840 2160` — any multiple works). The render will produce a 1600×900 preview at the correct aspect ratio.
- **Aspect ratio is what matters**, not exact pixel dimensions. Get the `viewBox` ratio right; the user handles final scaling.

### Important: resvg Limitations
- **No CSS `@import` or Google Fonts loading.** resvg does not fetch external resources. It only uses locally installed system fonts. If the font isn't installed on the system, it falls back silently.
- **`<style>` blocks are partially supported.** Inline `style=""` attributes or direct SVG attributes (e.g. `font-weight="700"`) are more reliable than `<style>` rules.
- **Filters work** (`<feDropShadow>`, etc.) but keep them simple — complex filter chains can slow rendering.

## Brand Identity

All graphics use the Elastic brand identity. These elements are consistent across every graphic type.

### Color Palette (Universal)
| Role | Color | Usage |
|------|-------|-------|
| Background (light) | `#F0F3F8` | Default page fill for opaque backgrounds |
| Card/box fill | `white` | Card backgrounds |
| Card border | `#D3DAE6` | Subtle borders |
| Strong border | `#8B95A5` | More visible borders, muted UI elements |
| Title text | `#1C1E23` | Headings, bold text, primary content |
| Body text | `#3D4250` | Paragraphs, descriptions |
| Muted text | `#5A6068` | Secondary text, labels, punctuation |
| Dimmed text | `#98A2B3` | Comments, footnotes, attribution |
| Code key / link | `#0B64DD` | JSON keys, verbs, highlighted terms |
| Code string / success | `#36B37E` | String values, positive indicators |
| Code number / error | `#D94C4C` | Numeric values, warnings |
| Inline code bg | `#E6EBF2` | Badge/pill background for inline code |

### Accent Color Palette
Use a **different accent color** for each visual group/section/card. These are purely decorative — no semantic meaning.

**Primary accents** (prefer these first):
| Color | Hex |
|-------|-----|
| Yellow | `#FEC514` |
| Teal | `#48EFCF` |
| Coral | `#FF957D` |
| Pink | `#F04E98` |
| Blue | `#0B64DD` |
| Navy | `#153385` |

**Extended accents** (when >6 groups needed): `#101C3F`, `#343741`, `#36B37E`, `#E0558A`, `#9ADC30`, `#02bcb7`.

### Fonts
- **Proportional**: `Inter, system-ui, -apple-system, sans-serif` — for headings, body text, labels
- **Monospace**: `'Space Mono', 'JetBrains Mono', monospace` — for code, technical values, model names
- Always include fallback chains — resvg only uses locally installed fonts

### Elastic Logo & Branding
- Logo asset: `assets/logo-elastic-horizontal-color.svg` — full-color horizontal Elastic logo
- Cluster decoration: `assets/elastic-cluster-3d-lightonly.svg` — 3D cluster for background watermarks
- Place the logo in footer/attribution areas. Scale to fit context (e.g. `scale(0.16)` for cheat-sheets, larger for presentation graphics)

### Universal Card/Box Pattern
The fundamental building block across ALL graphic types is a **white rounded-rect card with an accent-colored border and drop shadow**. This pattern appears in cheat-sheets, pipelines, and standalone presentation graphics alike.

```
┌─────────────────────────┐
│  LABEL (uppercase)       │  ← Inter bold, muted or accent color
│  Content Name            │  ← Space Mono bold, #1C1E23
│                          │
│  (description or detail) │  ← Inter regular, #5A6068
└─────────────────────────┘
```

**Core card styling:**
- `fill="#ffffff"` white background
- Colored `stroke` from the accent palette — each card uses a **different accent color**
- Rounded corners (`rx` proportional to card size)
- Drop shadow via `<filter>` with `feGaussianBlur` — prominent enough to give depth
- Text hierarchy inside: uppercase label → bold content → regular description

Template-specific variations:
- **Cheat-sheets** add a header tab with an accent strip overlapping the top border
- **Pipelines** use the colored border itself as the accent (no tab)
- **Novel graphics** should use the base pattern and adapt as needed

**Reference**: `references/202607-search-pipeline.svg` is the most adaptable reference — its card style, colors, and typography work for almost any graphic type. **Start here when no specific template applies.**

### Universal Background Pattern
For opaque graphics (non-transparent):
- `#F0F3F8` full-canvas fill
- Optional grid overlay: `<pattern>` with light strokes (`#5a6068` or `#CBD2DC`, low opacity)
- Optional cluster watermark: `assets/elastic-cluster-3d-lightonly.svg` behind content at large scale

These decorative elements add texture and brand identity. They are optional — use them when the graphic benefits from a richer background.

---

## Typography & Font Sizing

### Monospace Character Width Rule
**At `font-size: 12.5` with monospace fonts, each character is approximately 7.5px wide.**

This is critical for aligning code blocks. Use this formula:
```
x_position = base_x + (column_number × 7.5)
```

For other monospace sizes, scale proportionally:
| Font Size | Approx Char Width |
|-----------|------------------|
| 11        | ~6.6px           |
| 12        | ~7.2px           |
| 12.5      | ~7.5px           |
| 13        | ~7.8px           |
| 14        | ~8.4px           |

### Code Block Line Spacing
- Default 22px line intervals feel too loose for code. **Use 18px intervals** for tighter, more reference-card-like density.
- This applies to the y-coordinate spacing between consecutive `<text>` elements in code blocks.

### Proportional (Inter) Text
- **Do not try to calculate exact pixel widths** for proportional fonts. They vary by character.
- For inline code badges within prose, estimate width by character count × ~7.5px (for the monospace portion) and add ~12px padding.
- For section header text with `letter-spacing: 2.2`, the text will be roughly 20-30% wider than default.

### Font Size Scaling by Context
Font sizes depend on canvas size and viewing context. These are guidelines — scale proportionally.

**Err on the side of larger text.** Text that looks fine in an SVG editor often appears small when rendered to PNG or viewed on screen. Always compare rendered output to references.

| Context | Title | Body | Labels | Code | Footer |
|---------|-------|------|--------|------|--------|
| Cheat-sheet (860px wide) | 48px | 15.5px | 11.5px | 12.5px | 12px |
| Pipeline/presentation (2400px wide) | 72px | 24–27px | 27px | 25.5px | 17px |
| 16:9 overlay (1920px wide) | ~72px | ~24px | ~27px | ~24px | ~16px |

For novel canvas sizes, scale from the pipeline reference proportionally (title ≈ 3% of width, body ≈ 1–1.2%, labels ≈ 1.1%, code ≈ 1.1%, footer ≈ 0.7%). The reference pipeline SVGs use a **2400px wide canvas** — scale up or down from there. When in doubt, go bigger.

### Using `<tspan>` for Inline Color Changes
Use `<tspan>` elements inside a single `<text>` for syntax highlighting:
```xml
<text x="435" y="120">
  <tspan fill="#0B64DD">"title"</tspan>
  <tspan fill="#5A6068">: </tspan>
  <tspan fill="#36B37E">"Hello"</tspan>
  <tspan fill="#5A6068">,</tspan>
</text>
```
**This is much better than separate `<text>` elements** because:
1. Character spacing is natural — the browser/renderer advances the cursor correctly
2. No need to manually calculate x-positions for each colored segment
3. Fewer elements = simpler SVG

**Only use separate `<text>` elements** when you need a large gap (e.g. aligning comments at a fixed column away from code).

---

## Transparent Background Graphics

When a task requires transparent backgrounds (e.g. for video compositing):
- **Do NOT set a background fill** on the canvas — leave it transparent
- Use `fill="none"` or omit background `<rect>` elements entirely
- Test visibility against both light and dark backgrounds — elements need sufficient contrast for both if the task says "dark background compatible"
- Grid patterns and watermark decorations typically don't apply — those are for opaque infographic backgrounds
- The Elastic cluster watermark can still be used but may need adjusted opacity

---

# DESIGN SYSTEM TEMPLATES

These templates capture specific layout patterns for known graphic types. **Always study the actual reference SVGs/PNGs first** (per the Prime Directive above) — these written specs are for precise measurements and edge cases.

| Task Type | Template | Reference Files |
|-----------|----------|-----------------|
| Reference card / cheat-sheet | Elastic Infographic Style (below) | `references/mappings.*`, `references/vec-sims.*` |
| Flow / pipeline / architecture | Pipeline & Architecture Diagrams (below) | `references/202607-*.svg` |
| Any other graphic | Novel / Non-Template Graphics (below) | Start with `references/202607-search-pipeline.*` |

---

## Design System — Elastic Infographic Style

Uses the universal color palette and accent colors from Part 1. Additional cheat-sheet-specific color roles:
| Role | Color | Usage |
|------|-------|-------|
| Accent green | `#36B37E` | Dynamic mapping section |
| Accent blue | `#0B64DD` | Explicit mapping section |
| Accent pink | `#E0558A` | Runtime fields section |

### Section Accent Colors
Each card has a colored accent strip at the top of its header tab. Use a **different accent color per card** (see universal accent palette in Part 1).

All tabs use the same structural pattern: a white rounded-rect tab with a thin (5px) colored strip across the top. Do **not** add extra decorative ribbons or dual-color effects unless the reference explicitly shows them.

### Layout Grid
- **Canvas**: 860px wide, height flexible (size to fit content — no fixed aspect ratio required). Typical range: 1100–1300px tall depending on number of sections.
- **Outer margin**: 36–44px
- **Card width**: 788px (= 860 - 2×36)
- **Card padding**: 24–26px internal
- **Card border**: `stroke="#8B95A5" stroke-width="2"` (dark, thick — not subtle)
- **Card shadow**: prominent `feDropShadow` with `stdDeviation="6"`, `dx="2" dy="4"`, `flood-opacity="0.18"`
- **Card corner radius**: 10px
- **Code block**: right-aligned in card, corner radius=8px. Width and left edge vary per section — **size each code block to fit its content**. Wider code (e.g. long strings) needs a wider box. Don't force all code blocks to identical dimensions.
- **Bullet text column**: x=52 (after 40px indent + 12px for bullet)
- **Bullet text max width**: ~340px (to leave room for code block)
- **Section gap**: ~45px between cards
- **Bottom padding in cards/code blocks**: Keep tight — ~20px below the last content element. Avoid dead space.

### Card Structure Pattern
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ ┌──[ACCENT BAR]──────────────┐              │
│ │  SECTION HEADER LABEL      │              │
│ └────────────────────────────┘              │
│ Bold intro sentence. Regular continuation.  │
│                                             │
│ • Bullet point 1           ┌─────────────┐  │
│ • Bullet point 2           │ CODE BLOCK  │  │
│ • Bullet with `inline`     │ with syntax │  │
│ • Bullet point 4           │ highlighting│  │
│                            └─────────────┘  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Keep padding tight — the original reference looks dense/compact. Avoid excessive whitespace between the intro sentence and first bullet, or between bullets.

### Removing Dead Space & Adjusting Canvas Height
Cards and code blocks should be sized to fit their content snugly (~20px padding below the last text element). When shrinking cards:

1. **Shrink from the bottom** — modify the bottom y-coordinates in card `<path>` elements and code block `<path>`/`<rect>` elements
2. **Shift subsequent sections up** using `transform="translate(0, -Npx)"` on section `<g>` groups, where N = cumulative pixels saved by previous sections
3. **Reduce canvas height** to match: update the root `<svg>` `height`, `viewBox`, background `<path>`, and any `<filter>` elements that reference the canvas dimensions

This approach is much simpler than recalculating every absolute y-coordinate within a section — the `translate` on the group moves everything uniformly.

### Header Tab
- Positioned at y=-15 relative to card top (overlapping the border)
- Height: 30px, rounded corners (rx=5)
- Accent color strip: 4px tall at the top of the tab
- Text: uppercase, letter-spacing 2.2, font-size 11.5, font-weight 700
- Use `·` (middle dot) as separator between title parts

### Inline Code Badges
- Background rect with `rx="4"`, fill `#E0E5ED`, stroke `#C5CCD8`
- Add ~8px horizontal padding, ~4px vertical padding around the text
- Monospace font at 13.5px

**Spacing is ad-hoc, not formulaic.** Since inline badges sit between proportional (Inter) text, you cannot calculate their x-position from the preceding text width — proportional fonts vary per character. Instead:
1. Render once with an estimated position
2. Visually check the gap between the preceding word and the badge
3. Adjust the badge rect + text x-coordinates until the gap looks natural (~4–6px)

This applies to all inline code in prose: `dynamic_templates`, `properties`, `emit()`, `Painless`, `Update mapping API`, etc.

### Background Decorations
- **Grid pattern**: 40px squares, very light (`#CBD2DC`, opacity 0.5, stroke-width 0.5)
- **Radiating lines**: bottom-right corner, emanating from corner point, opacity 0.12
- **Cluster watermark**: Use `assets/elastic-cluster-3d-lightonly.svg` — include the full SVG content (all paths, masks, shading) at **large scale (~0.8) and full opacity** (`opacity="1"`). The cluster's own colors (`#e6ebf2` fills, `#1c1e23` strokes, `#f5f7fa` panels) are already light/subtle, so no additional opacity reduction is needed. Position it **behind all cards** (immediately after the background rect/grid in SVG layer order), clipped with a `<clipPath>` to the card area (e.g. starting from y≈300). It should be large and bold, spanning most of the lower canvas and overflowing the right edge — see `references/mappings.svg` for the layering approach.

### Elastic Logo
- Place the full-color horizontal Elastic logo (`assets/logo-elastic-horizontal-color.svg`) in the **bottom-right footer area**, in line with the SOURCE text.
- Scale: `scale(0.16)` — renders at about 82×48px.
- Position: inside the footer `<g>` group, at approximately `translate(740, -2)` relative to the footer group origin.
- The logo SVG contains all brand colors (yellow, teal, pink, blue, green) and the "elastic" wordmark — include all paths directly.

# COMMON PITFALLS

Hard-won lessons from previous graphics. Pitfalls 1–18 are mostly SVG mechanics; Pitfall 19 covers visual design anti-patterns that apply to ALL graphic types.

### 1. Monospace text overlap
**Problem**: Placing monospace `<text>` elements at manually-calculated x-positions often leads to overlap or gaps.
**Solution**: Use `<tspan>` inside a single `<text>` element. Only use separate `<text>` for widely-separated columns (e.g. code vs. trailing comment).

### 2. Font not rendering
**Problem**: Text renders in a fallback serif font.
**Solution**: Ensure the font is installed on the system. resvg does NOT load web fonts. Use `font-family` fallback chains with `system-ui` and `-apple-system`.

**For monospace**: Use `'Space Mono', 'JetBrains Mono', monospace` — Space Mono may not be installed everywhere, so always include a fallback that IS installed.

### 3. `<defs>` placement
**Problem**: `<clipPath>` or other defs inside a `<g>` may not work in all renderers.
**Solution**: Place all `<defs>` at the top level of the SVG, or at least ensure IDs are globally unique. (resvg handles nested defs but it's safer to hoist them.)

### 4. Card shadow clipping
**Problem**: Drop shadow filter gets clipped.
**Solution**: When using `filterUnits="userSpaceOnUse"` (absolute coordinates), the filter region must cover the element **in its local coordinate space** (before any `transform`). If a group has `transform="translate(0,-95)"` but the card inside goes to y=1173, the filter `height` must be ≥1173 + shadow extent — even if the canvas is only 1120px tall. Shrinking filter dimensions to match the canvas will clip content that exists beyond the canvas height in local space.

Alternatively, use `filterUnits="objectBoundingBox"` with percentage-based regions (e.g. `x="-5%" width="110%"`) to avoid this entirely.

### 5. Letter-spacing widens header tabs
**Problem**: Section header text with `letter-spacing: 2.2` is wider than expected, overflowing the tab.
**Solution**: Estimate ~1.3× the normal text width when using letter-spacing values > 1. Test and measure.

### 6. Two-column grid layouts
**Problem**: Adapting the single-column card pattern from `references/mappings.svg` to a 2-column grid layout.
**Solution**: Use `<g transform="translate(x, y)">` for each card's position. For an 860px canvas:
- Left column: `translate(36, y)`
- Right column: `translate(440, y)`
- Card width: 384px (= (860 - 72 - 20) / 2, where 72 = margins, 20 = gap)
- Row gap: ~38–42px between card rows

All coordinates inside a card group are **local** (relative to the group origin), making it easy to copy/adjust cards without recalculating absolute positions.

### 7. Diagram areas inside cards
**Problem**: Reference images contain vector diagrams (coordinate plots, arrows) alongside text.
**Solution**: Use a `<rect>` with subtle fill (`#F8F9FC`) and border (`#D3DAE6`) as the diagram container. Size ~150×138px on the left side of the card. Draw axes with light strokes, vectors with colored lines + circles for points, and dashed lines for projections. Keep diagrams schematic — exact geometric accuracy isn't needed; visual clarity is.

### 8. Formula/math badges
**Problem**: Formulas with subscripts, special characters (Σ, √, ‖, ², ÷) need careful rendering.
**Solution**: Use Unicode characters directly in `<tspan>` elements: `Σ`, `√`, `²`, `÷`, `‖`, `·`. Subscripts like `ᵢ` (Unicode subscript i) render correctly in monospace fonts. Avoid trying to position subscripts manually with font-size changes — use Unicode subscript characters when available.

### 9. Card dead space — keep cards tight
**Problem**: Cards end up with large gaps between the last content (e.g. formula badge at y≈154) and the footer separator line (e.g. at y≈210).
**Solution**: Place the footer separator ~14–16px below the last content element. For example, if the formula badge bottom is at y=154, put the separator at y=168, footer text at y=188, and card height at ~198. **Always check for dead space** after initial layout — it's one of the most common issues.

### 10. Text sizing — match reference scale
**Problem**: Initial text sizes (13.5px body, 42px title) appear noticeably smaller than the reference images when rendered.
**Solution**: Use larger text sizes that match the reference proportions:
- Title: **48px** (not 42)
- Subtitle: **16.5px** (not 15)
- Card body text: **15.5px** (not 13.5)
- Card footer text: **12px** (not 10)
- Summary callout title: **24px** (not 21)
- Summary callout body: **14px** (not 12.5)

Always compare the rendered output side-by-side with the reference image to verify text scale.

### 11. Cluster watermark — use full asset, large and bold
**Problem**: Using a simplified silhouette path at low opacity produces a faint grey blob instead of the detailed 3D cluster.
**Solution**: Include the full `elastic-cluster-3d-lightonly.svg` content (all paths, masks, shading groups) at **large scale (0.8+) and opacity 1.0**. The asset's own colors are already subtle. Place it behind all cards using SVG layer order + `<clipPath>` clipping. Do NOT reduce opacity further — the natural colors are the right level of subtlety.

### 12. Plan layout to fit the canvas — not the other way around
**Problem**: Defaulting to single-column with many cards produces infographics far taller than the references (1000–1300px), losing the "at-a-glance" quality.
**Solution**: The references are the target — aim for a similar canvas height. Before writing SVG, look at the content and decide what layout achieves that. Single-column, 2-column, hybrid (mix of full-width and 2-column rows) are all valid. Let the content drive the choice: wide content (code blocks) may need full width; compact content (bullet lists) often fits half-width. When content is too wide for a half-width card, abbreviate — factor out common prefixes, split long lines across two rows, use shorter descriptions.

### 13. Every `<text>` element needs a unique y-position
**Problem**: When manually placing lines in code blocks, it's easy to accidentally assign the same y-coordinate to two lines, causing overlap.
**Solution**: Use consistent 18px intervals and double-check for duplicate y values. This is especially common with closing braces in nested JSON.

### 14. Inline `<tspan>` for mixed font styling
**Problem**: Bullets that mix proportional body text with monospace inline code need multiple font switches within a single line.
**Solution**: Use `<tspan>` elements inside a single `<text>` to switch `font-family` mid-line. Set monospace `<tspan>` to a slightly smaller `font-size` (12–13px vs 15.5px body) for visual balance. Apply `fill="#0B64DD"` to monospace spans to highlight them as code.

### 15. Whitespace in `<tspan>` is collapsed — use explicit x-positions for indentation
**Problem**: Using space characters inside `<tspan>` elements (e.g. `<tspan>    </tspan>` for indentation) doesn't work — SVG collapses multiple whitespace characters, so all code lines render flush-left regardless of intended indentation.
**Solution**: Use separate `<text>` elements with explicit `x` coordinates for each indentation level. Calculate x-offsets from the monospace character width:
- Base (0 indent): `x=354`
- 2-space indent: `x=354 + 2×6.6 = 367` (at font-size 11)
- 4-space indent: `x=354 + 4×6.6 = 380`
- 8-space indent: `x=354 + 8×6.6 = 407`

This is more reliable than `xml:space="preserve"` (which resvg may not fully support) and produces clean, predictable indentation.

### 16. Dark code blocks for JSON/config content
**Problem**: Light code blocks (white/grey backgrounds) don't visually distinguish code from surrounding card content strongly enough.
**Solution**: Use `fill="#1C1E23"` (near-black) on the code block `<rect>` with colored text for syntax highlighting. This creates a "dark editor" aesthetic that stands out well against white cards. Use the standard syntax colors on the dark background:
- Keys: `#0B64DD` (blue)
- Strings: `#36B37E` (green)
- Punctuation: `#5A6068` (muted grey)

### 17. Long code lines — wrap with increased indentation
**Problem**: JSON key-value pairs with long keys (e.g. `"CLAUDE_CODE_ENHANCED_TELEMETRY_BETA"`) and values don't fit on a single line in the code block.
**Solution**: Break the line after the `:` and render the value on the next line with double indentation (8 spaces). This preserves readability while fitting within the code block width:

### 18. Hybrid layouts — full-width + 2-column rows
**Problem**: Some infographics have a mix of wide content (like JSON configs) and compact content (bullet lists, metric tables).
**Solution**: Use a hybrid layout: full-width cards for content that needs horizontal space (code blocks, tables), then 2-column rows for compact content. This keeps the canvas height within the 1000–1300px target while giving each card the width it needs. The full-width card uses the standard 788px width; the 2-column cards use 384px each.

### 19. Visual anti-patterns — design choices that break the brand style
**Problem**: Agent invents visual patterns not present in any reference.
**Common violations and fixes**:

| ❌ Anti-pattern | ✅ Correct approach |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| Full-width colored fill headers (banner bars across card top) | Colored **border stroke** on the card; small accent pill for the label |
| Pastel-tinted row/section backgrounds (`#f0fff4`, `#f0f6ff`) | White (`#ffffff`) card fill — always |
| Font sizes chosen by gut feel (e.g. 30px body on 2400px canvas) | Look up the Font Size Scaling table |
| Thin grey borders (`stroke-width="2"`, `#D3DAE6`) as the main card outline | Thick colored borders (`stroke-width="3.75"+`) from the accent palette |
| "Spreadsheet" layouts with grid lines separating rows | Separate white cards with shadows for each content group |
| Large persona/label badges (>30px tall) competing with content | Small subtle pills — labels are secondary to the content they describe |
| Colored divider lines between rows within a card | White space or subtle `#D3DAE6` lines only |

**Rule of thumb**: Before finalizing, compare every visual element to the reference PNGs. If you can't find a precedent for your design choice in any reference, replace it with the closest reference pattern.

# DESIGN SYSTEM TEMPLATES (continued)

## Design System — Novel / Non-Template Graphics

When the task doesn't match a cheat-sheet or pipeline layout (e.g. comparison grids, feature matrices, decision trees, control panels), use these rules:

1. **Use pipeline font sizes** for any canvas ≥ 1920px wide. Use cheat-sheet font sizes for canvas ≤ 860px. Interpolate for sizes in between. The pipeline font sizes (72px title, 27px labels, 24px body on a 2400px canvas) are calibrated for video/screen readability — don't shrink them.

2. **Decompose your layout into cards.** Every content group should be a white rounded-rect card with a thick colored accent border and drop shadow. This is the universal building block — there are no exceptions. See "Universal Card/Box Pattern" above.

3. **One accent color per major group**, not per row or sub-element. Three panels = three accent colors. The accent goes on the card's `stroke`. Interior content uses the standard text colors (`#1C1E23` for headings, `#5A6068` for body, `#98A2B3` for muted).

4. **Small label pills for categories**, not full-width banners. If a card has sub-categories (e.g. Quality / Speed / Cost), show them as small rounded-rect pills (~100×30px) with the category color fill and white bold text. These sit *inside* the card as labels, not as header bars spanning the card width.

5. **Study `references/202607-search-pipeline.svg` and its PNG** — its card style is the most transferable to novel layouts. Note specifically: white fill, thick colored stroke, prominent shadow, uppercase category label in Inter bold, content name in Space Mono bold.

6. **Tight sizing.** Cards should be sized to fit their content with ~20px padding. Don't create cards that are 50%+ empty space. If content only fills 150px of a 480px card, shrink the card.

7. **Visual hierarchy via font weight and size**, not via background colors. Distinguish sections using bold/regular weight, larger/smaller sizes, and accent-colored text — not by tinting backgrounds different colors.

## Design System — Pipeline & Architecture Diagrams

For large-format pipeline/flow diagrams (e.g. ingestion flows, search architectures), a different set of patterns applies compared to the compact cheat-sheet style above. These diagrams are designed for **video/streaming presentation** at 16:9 aspect ratio.

### Reference Examples
All pipeline references are in `references/` with matching PNG renders:
- **Search pipeline**: `references/202607-search-pipeline.svg` (.png) — multi-path search with converging kNN
- **Ingestion pipeline**: `references/202607-omnimodal-ingestion.svg` (.png) — video indexing flow with forking paths, unified encoder, ES output
- **Architecture overview**: `references/202607-omnimodal-architecture.svg` (.png) — system components diagram

### Canvas & Aspect Ratio
- **Canvas**: 2400×1350 (16:9 ratio) for YouTube/streaming-friendly dimensions
- **Background**: `#F0F3F8` full-canvas fill, same as cheat-sheet style
- **Grid overlay**: Use a `<pattern>` fill on the canvas border (`stroke="#5a6068" stroke-width="3.75"`) for subtle grid texture
- **Decorative watermark**: Elastic cluster illustration at low opacity (`0.1–0.25`) behind content, clipped to canvas area

### Font Size Hierarchy for Streaming Readability
Pipeline diagrams must be readable on video streams and presentation screens. Use much larger fonts than cheat-sheets:

| Element | Font | Size | Weight | Color | Notes |
|---------|------|------|--------|-------|-------|
| **Title** | Inter | 72px | 700 | `#1C1E23` | Negative letter-spacing (-1.7) for tight display type |
| **Subtitle** | Inter / Space Mono mix | 36px | 400–700 | `#5A6068` | Use Space Mono bold for technical terms inline |
| **Path/section headers** | Inter | 27px | 700 | Accent color | e.g. "TEXT PATH", "VOICE PIPELINE PATH" — use path's accent color |
| **Category labels** | Inter | 27px | 700 | `#5A6068` | e.g. "INPUT", "TRANSCRIBE", "EMBED" — with `letter-spacing="3"` |
| **Content names** | Space Mono | 27px | 700 | `#1C1E23` | e.g. "Whisper", "ffmpeg", "Text Query" |
| **Featured text** | Inter | 33–42px | 700 | `#1C1E23` | e.g. "Omnimodal encoder", "kNN Search" — hero elements |
| **Model names** | Space Mono | 25.5px | 700 | `#1C1E23` | e.g. "jina-embeddings / -v5-omni" |
| **Description text** | Inter | 24px | 400 | `#5A6068` | Supporting info: "One model embeds all modalities..." |
| **Section sub-headers** | Inter | 24px | 700 | `#5A6068` | e.g. "EMBEDS", "OUTPUT", "INPUTS" — with `letter-spacing="2.5"` |
| **Modality items** | Inter | 27px | 400 | `#1C1E23` | e.g. "Text", "Audio", "Video", "Image" |
| **Key callout text** | Space Mono | 25.5px | 700 | `#0B64DD` | e.g. "compatible vectors", "into one vector space" |
| **Table row labels** | Inter | 27px | 700 | `#1C1E23` | Bottom comparison table path names |
| **Table step counts** | Space Mono | 24px | 700 | Accent color | e.g. "1 step", "3 steps" — colored per path |
| **Table descriptions** | Inter | 22.5px | 400 | `#5A6068` | e.g. "embed text → search" |
| **Tech pills (small)** | Space Mono | 18px | 400 | `#1C1E23` | Tool names in comparison tables |
| **Footer/source** | Space Mono | 17px | 700 | `#98A2B3` | Bottom attribution |

**Key principle**: Structural labels (what the step IS) should be large and bold for at-a-glance scanning. Technical details (specific tool names, descriptions) can be smaller — they provide context without competing for attention.

### Card/Box Structure
Pipeline steps use **white rounded-rect cards** with colored borders and drop shadows:

```
┌─────────────────────────┐
│  CATEGORY LABEL          │  ← Inter 27px bold, #5A6068, letter-spacing 3
│  Content Name            │  ← Space Mono 27px bold, #1C1E23
│                          │
│  (optional description)  │  ← Inter 24px, #5A6068
└─────────────────────────┘
```

**Card styling**:
- `fill="#ffffff"` white background
- `stroke-width="3.75"` colored border — each card uses a **different accent color** from the palette
- `rx` for rounded corners (matching the card size — larger cards get larger radii)
- Drop shadow via `<filter>` with `feGaussianBlur stdDeviation="9"` — prominent shadow for depth
- **No header tab** (unlike cheat-sheet cards) — the colored border IS the accent

**Accent color assignments** (one per logical group):
| Color | Hex | Usage Example |
|-------|-----|---------------|
| Blue | `#0B64DD` | Text input path |
| Pink | `#F04E98` | Voice pipeline path |
| Green | `#9ADC30` | Direct audio path |
| Orange | `#FF957D` | Processing steps (Whisper, LLM) |
| Yellow | `#FEC514` | Encoder (spanning box) |
| Teal | `#48EFCF` | Elasticsearch/output (spanning box) |
| Dark | `#1C1E23` | Final output |
| Muted | `#8B95A5` | Neutral/utility boxes (ffmpeg, comparison table) |

### Spanning Boxes
When a component serves multiple paths (e.g. an omnimodal encoder or kNN search), use a **tall spanning box** that visually bridges all paths:

- Taller `stroke-width="4.5"` border (thicker than regular cards)
- Contains multiple sub-sections separated by `#D3DAE6` divider lines
- Internal structure: category label → model name → description → divider → sub-section → divider → output section
- All paths' arrows converge into/emerge from this single box

### Dashed-Border Grouping Regions
Use dashed-stroke rounded rects to group related steps into logical phases:

```svg
<path fill="none" stroke="#8B95A5" stroke-width="3.4"
      stroke-dasharray="13.7 6.85" d="M ... Z"/>
```

- **Outer group** (e.g. "FOR EACH SCENE"): `stroke="#8B95A5"` (gray), `stroke-width ~3.4`, larger dash pattern
- **Sub-groups** (e.g. "EMBED TRANSCRIPT"): Path's accent color, `stroke-width ~1.7`, smaller dash pattern
- Label the region with a bold Inter text element positioned at the top-left of the dashed border

### Arrows & Flow Lines
Connecting arrows between cards use simple straight lines:

```svg
<path fill="#000000" stroke="#5A6068" stroke-width="3.75"
      d="M 342 315 L 972 315"/>
```

- **Color**: `#5A6068` (muted gray) — uniform across all arrows
- **Stroke width**: `3.75` for main flow lines
- **No arrowheads** in the final designs — the flow direction is implied by left-to-right reading order and the visual hierarchy
- **Dashed arrows** for secondary/internal flows: `stroke-dasharray="13 8"` with same gray color

### Gradient & Color Indicator Dots
Use small gradient-filled rounded rects as modality indicators:

```svg
<linearGradient id="gradient1">
  <stop offset="0" stop-color="#02bcb7"/>  <!-- teal for audio/video -->
  <stop offset="1" stop-color="#f04e98"/>  <!-- pink for text -->
</linearGradient>
<path fill="url(#gradient1)" d="M ... Z" rx="9"/>  <!-- 18×36 colored dot -->
```

These provide subtle visual cues for which modalities a component handles.

### Modality Pills
For encoder/model boxes that handle multiple modalities, show capability with colored pills:

| Modality | Background | Text Color | Label Font |
|----------|-----------|------------|------------|
| video | `#02bcb7` | white | Inter 19px bold |
| audio | `#02bcb7` | white | Inter 19px bold |
| image | `#FEC514` | `#D4A017` | Inter 19px bold |
| text | `#F04E98` | white | Inter 19px bold |

Distribute pills evenly across the encoder box bottom area with consistent spacing.

### Bottom Comparison Table
Include a summary comparison table at the bottom of pipeline diagrams:

- White rounded-rect container with muted border (`stroke="#8B95A5" stroke-width="6"`)
- Horizontal divider lines (`stroke="#D3DAE6" stroke-width="3"`) between rows
- **Column alignment** (use consistent x-positions across all rows):
  - Path name: ~x=300
  - Step count: ~x=860
  - Description: ~x=1220
  - Tech pills: ~x=2370+
- **Key insight row** at the bottom with bold label + explanatory text

### Branding Badge
Top-right corner badge with colored border:

```svg
<path fill="#F0F3F8" stroke="#FEC514" stroke-width="4"
      stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"
      d="M ... Z" rx="20"/>  <!-- rounded rect -->
```

Contains logo or wordmark, with a vertical divider line inside.

### Layout Principles for Pipeline Diagrams

1. **Left-to-right flow**: Input → Processing → Encoding → Storage/Output
2. **Parallel paths stack vertically**: Multiple input paths arranged top-to-bottom with consistent vertical spacing (~267px between path centers)
3. **Convergence points**: Use spanning boxes where paths merge
4. **Divergence points**: Show forking with dashed-border regions containing sub-paths
5. **Generous spacing**: Cards need breathing room — minimum ~30px gaps between elements
6. **Title block**: Top-left, with title (72px) and subtitle (36px) establishing context before the diagram
7. **Comparison table**: Bottom section summarizing paths/options — always include for multi-path diagrams
8. **Keep technical detail subordinate**: Category labels ("TRANSCRIBE") and structural labels ("FOR EACH SCENE") should dominate; tool names ("Whisper") and descriptions are supporting detail

## Iterative Workflow
1. Write/edit your SVG (e.g. `output.svg`)
2. Run `node render.js output.svg output.png`
3. Review the PNG — check for text overlap, alignment, missing fonts
4. Adjust and repeat

Typical issues per iteration:
- **Iter 1**: Layout structure, rough positioning → discover font fallback issues, text overlap
- **Iter 2**: Fix monospace spacing by switching to `<tspan>` → discover inline code badge misalignment
- **Iter 3**: Fine-tune positions, verify final output
