# Agent Design Notes — SVG Infographic Creation

## Overview
This project creates SVG infographics (e.g. Elastic dev-advocacy cheat-sheets) and renders them to PNG via `@resvg/resvg-js`. This file captures key learnings for any agent recreating or extending these designs.

---

## Rendering Pipeline

### Setup
- **resvg-js** is installed globally at `/Users/jphwang/.local/share/mise/installs/node/22.22.0/lib/node_modules/@resvg/resvg-js`
- Use `render.js` to convert SVG → PNG: `node render.js <input.svg> <output.png>`
- resvg loads system fonts, so `font-family` values should include fallbacks (e.g. `Inter, system-ui, -apple-system, sans-serif`)

### Important: resvg Limitations
- **No CSS `@import` or Google Fonts loading.** resvg does not fetch external resources. It only uses locally installed system fonts. If the font isn't installed on the system, it falls back silently.
- **`<style>` blocks are partially supported.** Inline `style=""` attributes or direct SVG attributes (e.g. `font-weight="700"`) are more reliable than `<style>` rules.
- **Filters work** (`<feDropShadow>`, etc.) but keep them simple — complex filter chains can slow rendering.

---

## Typography & Font Sizing

### Monospace Font Choice
- **Preferred**: `'Space Mono'` (Elastic brand-aligned), with fallback to `'JetBrains Mono', monospace`
- resvg only uses locally installed fonts. If Space Mono isn't installed, JetBrains Mono is a solid fallback.
- Previous iterations used Source Code Pro / Courier New / Helvetica — `Space Mono` or `JetBrains Mono` give a more distinctive, branded look.

### Monospace Character Width Rule
**At `font-size: 12.5` with monospace fonts, each character is approximately 7.5px wide.**

This is critical for aligning code blocks. Use this formula:
```
x_position = base_x + (column_number × 7.5)
```

For other monospace sizes, scale proportionally:
| Font Size | Approx Char Width |
|-----------|------------------|
| 11        | ~6.6px           |
| 12        | ~7.2px           |
| 12.5      | ~7.5px           |
| 13        | ~7.8px           |
| 14        | ~8.4px           |

### Code Block Line Spacing
- Default 22px line intervals feel too loose for code. **Use 18px intervals** for tighter, more reference-card-like density.
- This applies to the y-coordinate spacing between consecutive `<text>` elements in code blocks.

### Proportional (Inter) Text
- **Do not try to calculate exact pixel widths** for proportional fonts. They vary by character.
- For inline code badges within prose, estimate width by character count × ~7.5px (for the monospace portion) and add ~12px padding.
- For section header text with `letter-spacing: 2.2`, the text will be roughly 20-30% wider than default.

### Using `<tspan>` for Inline Color Changes
Use `<tspan>` elements inside a single `<text>` for syntax highlighting:
```xml
<text x="435" y="120">
  <tspan fill="#0B64DD">"title"</tspan>
  <tspan fill="#5A6068">: </tspan>
  <tspan fill="#36B37E">"Hello"</tspan>
  <tspan fill="#5A6068">,</tspan>
</text>
```
**This is much better than separate `<text>` elements** because:
1. Character spacing is natural — the browser/renderer advances the cursor correctly
2. No need to manually calculate x-positions for each colored segment
3. Fewer elements = simpler SVG

**Only use separate `<text>` elements** when you need a large gap (e.g. aligning comments at a fixed column away from code).

## Design System — Elastic Infographic Style

### Color Palette
| Role | Color | Usage |
|------|-------|-------|
| Background | `#F0F3F8` | Page fill |
| Card fill | `white` | Card backgrounds |
| Card border | `#D3DAE6` | Subtle borders |
| Title text | `#1C1E23` | Headings (font-weight 900), bold text |
| Body text | `#3D4250` | Paragraphs, bullets |
| Muted text | `#98A2B3` | Code comments |
| Code key | `#0B64DD` | JSON keys, PUT/GET verbs |
| Code string | `#36B37E` | String values, POST verb |
| Code number | `#D94C4C` | Numeric values |
| Code punct | `#5A6068` | Brackets, colons, commas |
| Inline code bg | `#E6EBF2` | Badge background for inline code |
| Accent green | `#36B37E` | Dynamic mapping section |
| Accent blue | `#0B64DD` | Explicit mapping section |
| Accent pink | `#E0558A` | Runtime fields section |


### Section Accent Colors
Each card section has a colored accent strip at the top of its header tab. Use a **different color for each card** from the Elastic brand palette to add visual variety. There is no semantic meaning to the color assignments — they are purely decorative highlights.

**Preferred accent palette** (from Elastic branding):
| Color | Hex |
|-------|-----|
| Yellow | `#FEC514` |
| Teal | `#48EFCF` |
| Coral | `#FF957D` |
| Pink | `#F04E98` |
| Blue | `#0B64DD` |
| Navy | `#153385` |

If more than 6 cards are needed, these additional colors can be used: `#101C3F`, `#343741`, `#36B37E`, `#E0558A`.

All tabs use the same structural pattern: a white rounded-rect tab with a thin (5px) colored strip across the top. Do **not** add extra decorative ribbons or dual-color effects unless the reference explicitly shows them.

### Layout Grid
- **Canvas**: 860px wide, height flexible (size to fit content — no fixed aspect ratio required). Typical range: 1100–1300px tall depending on number of sections.
- **Outer margin**: 36–44px
- **Card width**: 788px (= 860 - 2×36)
- **Card padding**: 24–26px internal
- **Card border**: `stroke="#8B95A5" stroke-width="2"` (dark, thick — not subtle)
- **Card shadow**: prominent `feDropShadow` with `stdDeviation="6"`, `dx="2" dy="4"`, `flood-opacity="0.18"`
- **Card corner radius**: 10px
- **Code block**: right-aligned in card, corner radius=8px. Width and left edge vary per section — **size each code block to fit its content**. Wider code (e.g. long strings) needs a wider box. Don't force all code blocks to identical dimensions.
- **Bullet text column**: x=52 (after 40px indent + 12px for bullet)
- **Bullet text max width**: ~340px (to leave room for code block)
- **Section gap**: ~45px between cards
- **Bottom padding in cards/code blocks**: Keep tight — ~20px below the last content element. Avoid dead space.

### Card Structure Pattern
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ ┌──[ACCENT BAR]──────────────┐              │
│ │  SECTION HEADER LABEL      │              │
│ └────────────────────────────┘              │
│ Bold intro sentence. Regular continuation.  │
│                                             │
│ • Bullet point 1           ┌─────────────┐  │
│ • Bullet point 2           │ CODE BLOCK  │  │
│ • Bullet with `inline`     │ with syntax │  │
│ • Bullet point 4           │ highlighting│  │
│                            └─────────────┘  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Keep padding tight — the original reference looks dense/compact. Avoid excessive whitespace between the intro sentence and first bullet, or between bullets.

### Removing Dead Space & Adjusting Canvas Height
Cards and code blocks should be sized to fit their content snugly (~20px padding below the last text element). When shrinking cards:

1. **Shrink from the bottom** — modify the bottom y-coordinates in card `<path>` elements and code block `<path>`/`<rect>` elements
2. **Shift subsequent sections up** using `transform="translate(0, -Npx)"` on section `<g>` groups, where N = cumulative pixels saved by previous sections
3. **Reduce canvas height** to match: update the root `<svg>` `height`, `viewBox`, background `<path>`, and any `<filter>` elements that reference the canvas dimensions

This approach is much simpler than recalculating every absolute y-coordinate within a section — the `translate` on the group moves everything uniformly.

### Header Tab
- Positioned at y=-15 relative to card top (overlapping the border)
- Height: 30px, rounded corners (rx=5)
- Accent color strip: 4px tall at the top of the tab
- Text: uppercase, letter-spacing 2.2, font-size 11.5, font-weight 700
- Use `·` (middle dot) as separator between title parts

### Inline Code Badges
- Background rect with `rx="4"`, fill `#E0E5ED`, stroke `#C5CCD8`
- Add ~8px horizontal padding, ~4px vertical padding around the text
- Monospace font at 13.5px

**Spacing is ad-hoc, not formulaic.** Since inline badges sit between proportional (Inter) text, you cannot calculate their x-position from the preceding text width — proportional fonts vary per character. Instead:
1. Render once with an estimated position
2. Visually check the gap between the preceding word and the badge
3. Adjust the badge rect + text x-coordinates until the gap looks natural (~4–6px)

This applies to all inline code in prose: `dynamic_templates`, `properties`, `emit()`, `Painless`, `Update mapping API`, etc.

### Background Decorations
- **Grid pattern**: 40px squares, very light (`#CBD2DC`, opacity 0.5, stroke-width 0.5)
- **Radiating lines**: bottom-right corner, emanating from corner point, opacity 0.12
- **Cluster watermark**: Use `assets/elastic-cluster-3d-lightonly.svg` — include the full SVG content (all paths, masks, shading) at **large scale (~0.8) and full opacity** (`opacity="1"`). The cluster's own colors (`#e6ebf2` fills, `#1c1e23` strokes, `#f5f7fa` panels) are already light/subtle, so no additional opacity reduction is needed. Position it **behind all cards** (immediately after the background rect/grid in SVG layer order), clipped with a `<clipPath>` to the card area (e.g. starting from y≈300). It should be large and bold, spanning most of the lower canvas and overflowing the right edge — see `references/mappings.svg` for the layering approach.

### Elastic Logo
- Place the full-color horizontal Elastic logo (`assets/logo-elastic-horizontal-color.svg`) in the **bottom-right footer area**, in line with the SOURCE text.
- Scale: `scale(0.16)` — renders at about 82×48px.
- Position: inside the footer `<g>` group, at approximately `translate(740, -2)` relative to the footer group origin.
- The logo SVG contains all brand colors (yellow, teal, pink, blue, green) and the "elastic" wordmark — include all paths directly.

## Common Pitfalls

### 1. Monospace text overlap
**Problem**: Placing monospace `<text>` elements at manually-calculated x-positions often leads to overlap or gaps.
**Solution**: Use `<tspan>` inside a single `<text>` element. Only use separate `<text>` for widely-separated columns (e.g. code vs. trailing comment).

### 2. Font not rendering
**Problem**: Text renders in a fallback serif font.
**Solution**: Ensure the font is installed on the system. resvg does NOT load web fonts. Use `font-family` fallback chains with `system-ui` and `-apple-system`.

**For monospace**: Use `'Space Mono', 'JetBrains Mono', monospace` — Space Mono may not be installed everywhere, so always include a fallback that IS installed.

### 3. `<defs>` placement
**Problem**: `<clipPath>` or other defs inside a `<g>` may not work in all renderers.
**Solution**: Place all `<defs>` at the top level of the SVG, or at least ensure IDs are globally unique. (resvg handles nested defs but it's safer to hoist them.)

### 4. Card shadow clipping
**Problem**: Drop shadow filter gets clipped.
**Solution**: When using `filterUnits="userSpaceOnUse"` (absolute coordinates), the filter region must cover the element **in its local coordinate space** (before any `transform`). If a group has `transform="translate(0,-95)"` but the card inside goes to y=1173, the filter `height` must be ≥1173 + shadow extent — even if the canvas is only 1120px tall. Shrinking filter dimensions to match the canvas will clip content that exists beyond the canvas height in local space.

Alternatively, use `filterUnits="objectBoundingBox"` with percentage-based regions (e.g. `x="-5%" width="110%"`) to avoid this entirely.

### 5. Letter-spacing widens header tabs
**Problem**: Section header text with `letter-spacing: 2.2` is wider than expected, overflowing the tab.
**Solution**: Estimate ~1.3× the normal text width when using letter-spacing values > 1. Test and measure.

### 6. Two-column grid layouts
**Problem**: Adapting the single-column card pattern from `references/mappings.svg` to a 2-column grid layout.
**Solution**: Use `<g transform="translate(x, y)">` for each card's position. For an 860px canvas:
- Left column: `translate(36, y)`
- Right column: `translate(440, y)`
- Card width: 384px (= (860 - 72 - 20) / 2, where 72 = margins, 20 = gap)
- Row gap: ~38–42px between card rows

All coordinates inside a card group are **local** (relative to the group origin), making it easy to copy/adjust cards without recalculating absolute positions.

### 7. Diagram areas inside cards
**Problem**: Reference images contain vector diagrams (coordinate plots, arrows) alongside text.
**Solution**: Use a `<rect>` with subtle fill (`#F8F9FC`) and border (`#D3DAE6`) as the diagram container. Size ~150×138px on the left side of the card. Draw axes with light strokes, vectors with colored lines + circles for points, and dashed lines for projections. Keep diagrams schematic — exact geometric accuracy isn't needed; visual clarity is.

### 8. Formula/math badges
**Problem**: Formulas with subscripts, special characters (Σ, √, ‖, ², ÷) need careful rendering.
**Solution**: Use Unicode characters directly in `<tspan>` elements: `Σ`, `√`, `²`, `÷`, `‖`, `·`. Subscripts like `ᵢ` (Unicode subscript i) render correctly in monospace fonts. Avoid trying to position subscripts manually with font-size changes — use Unicode subscript characters when available.

### 9. Card dead space — keep cards tight
**Problem**: Cards end up with large gaps between the last content (e.g. formula badge at y≈154) and the footer separator line (e.g. at y≈210).
**Solution**: Place the footer separator ~14–16px below the last content element. For example, if the formula badge bottom is at y=154, put the separator at y=168, footer text at y=188, and card height at ~198. **Always check for dead space** after initial layout — it's one of the most common issues.

### 10. Text sizing — match reference scale
**Problem**: Initial text sizes (13.5px body, 42px title) appear noticeably smaller than the reference images when rendered.
**Solution**: Use larger text sizes that match the reference proportions:
- Title: **48px** (not 42)
- Subtitle: **16.5px** (not 15)
- Card body text: **15.5px** (not 13.5)
- Card footer text: **12px** (not 10)
- Summary callout title: **24px** (not 21)
- Summary callout body: **14px** (not 12.5)

Always compare the rendered output side-by-side with the reference image to verify text scale.

### 11. Cluster watermark — use full asset, large and bold
**Problem**: Using a simplified silhouette path at low opacity produces a faint grey blob instead of the detailed 3D cluster.
**Solution**: Include the full `elastic-cluster-3d-lightonly.svg` content (all paths, masks, shading groups) at **large scale (0.8+) and opacity 1.0**. The asset's own colors are already subtle. Place it behind all cards using SVG layer order + `<clipPath>` clipping. Do NOT reduce opacity further — the natural colors are the right level of subtlety.

### 12. Table-like layouts in cards
**Problem**: Displaying tabular data (metric names + descriptions) inside cards without using `<table>` (not supported in SVG).
**Solution**: Use a header row with `<rect>` fill (`#E6EBF2`), then alternate `<text>` elements at fixed x-positions for columns. Use `<line>` separators between rows with `stroke-width="0.5" opacity="0.6"` for subtle dividers. Keep row spacing at ~34px intervals (y increment). Ensure the table area doesn't leave excessive dead space — size the card height precisely to the last row + footer gap.

### 13. Tall single-column infographics
**Problem**: Infographics with 5+ cards can exceed 2000px in height, requiring careful canvas sizing.
**Solution**: For tall infographics, build all cards with absolute y-coordinates rather than `translate()` transforms. This makes it easier to adjust card positions when removing dead space. After the first render, measure exact dead space gaps and shift subsequent cards up by updating their y-coordinates. Update canvas `height`, `viewBox`, background `<rect>`, and radiating line endpoints to match.

### 14. Code block with nested JSON — closing braces
**Problem**: When manually placing JSON closing braces (`}`) in code blocks, it's easy to accidentally assign the same y-coordinate to multiple lines.
**Solution**: Track y-positions carefully for every line in a code block. Use 18px line intervals consistently. For nested JSON, the inner `}` and outer `}` are on separate lines — give each its own y-position. Double-check by searching for duplicate y values in the code block section.

### 15. Inline `<tspan>` for mixed font styling in bullets
**Problem**: Bullets that mix proportional body text with monospace inline code need multiple font switches.
**Solution**: Use `<tspan>` elements inside a single `<text>` to switch between `font-family` values mid-line. Set the monospace `<tspan>` to a slightly smaller `font-size` (13px vs 15.5px body) for visual balance. Apply `fill="#0B64DD"` to monospace spans to highlight them as code references. This works well for event names, metric names, and env var references.

### 16. objectBoundingBox filter approach for tall SVGs
**Problem**: With `filterUnits="userSpaceOnUse"`, the filter region must cover all cards in absolute coordinates, which is error-prone for tall canvases.
**Solution**: Use `filterUnits="objectBoundingBox"` with percentage-based regions like `x="-5%" y="-3%" width="110%" height="112%"`. This automatically adapts to each card's bounding box regardless of its position on the canvas. Much simpler than maintaining absolute filter dimensions.

## Iterative Workflow
1. Write/edit your SVG (e.g. `output.svg`)
2. Run `node render.js output.svg output.png`
3. Review the PNG — check for text overlap, alignment, missing fonts
4. Adjust and repeat

Typical issues per iteration:
- **Iter 1**: Layout structure, rough positioning → discover font fallback issues, text overlap
- **Iter 2**: Fix monospace spacing by switching to `<tspan>` → discover inline code badge misalignment
- **Iter 3**: Fine-tune positions, verify final output
